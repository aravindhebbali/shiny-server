## Introduction

<hr>

In a previous module, we learnt about dplyr verbs and used them to compute average order value for an e-commerce website data. In this module, we will learn to combine tables using different `*_join` functions provided in dplyr. Let us assume we have 2 tables **x** and **y**. 

The following types of `join` functions are provided in dplyr:

- `inner_join()`
- `left_join()`
- `right_join()`
- `semi_join()`
- `anti_join()`
- `full_join()`


## Case Study

### Introduction

<hr>

![](/srv/shiny-server/dplyr-part-2/images/join_data.png){width=90%}

We have two data sets with details of customers and their orders. We will use 
the above functions to combine the data sets in different ways to glean 
information about customer orders. 

## Data

### Orders

<hr>

```{r dplyr2, exercise = TRUE, exercise.eval = FALSE, exercise.cap = 'Orders'}
order
```

### Customers

<hr>

```{r dplyr, exercise = TRUE, exercise.eval = FALSE, exercise.cap = 'Customers'}
customer
```

## Example Data 

<hr>

## Inner Join

<hr>

![](/srv/shiny-server/dplyr-part-2/images/draw_inner.png){width=90%}

`inner_join()` returns all rows from x where there are matching values in y, 
and all columns from x and y. If there are multiple matches between x and y, 
all combination of the matches are returned.

```{r dplyr3, exercise = TRUE, exercise.eval = FALSE, exercise.cap = 'Inner Join'}

```

```{r dplyr3-solution}
inner_join(customer, order, by = "id")
```

## Left Join

<hr>

`left_join()` returns all rows from x, and all columns from x and y. Rows in x 
with no match in y will have NA values in the new columns. If there are 
multiple matches between x and y, all combinations of the matches are returned.

![](/srv/shiny-server/dplyr-part-2/images/draw_left.png){width=90%}

```{r dplyr4, exercise = TRUE, exercise.eval = FALSE, exercise.cap = 'Left Join'}

```

```{r dplyr4-solution}
left_join(customer, order, by = "id")
```

## Right Join

<hr>

`right_join()` returns all rows from y, and all columns from x and y. Rows in y 
with no match in x will have NA values in the new columns. If there are 
multiple matches between x and y, all combinations of the matches are returned.

![](/srv/shiny-server/dplyr-part-2/images/draw_right.png){width=90%}

```{r dplyr5, exercise = TRUE, exercise.eval = FALSE, exercise.cap = 'Right Join'}

```

```{r dplyr5-solution}
right_join(customer, order, by = "id")
```

## Semi Join

<hr>

`semi_join()` returns all rows from x where there are matching values in y, 
keeping just columns from x. A semi join differs from an inner join because an 
inner join will return one row of x for each matching row of y, where a semi 
join will never duplicate rows of x.

![](/srv/shiny-server/dplyr-part-2/images/draw_semi.png){width=90%}

```{r dplyr6, exercise = TRUE, exercise.eval = FALSE, exercise.cap = 'Semi Join'}

```

```{r dplyr6-solution}
semi_join(customer, order, by = "id")
```

## Anti Join

<hr>

`anti_join()` returns all rows from x where there are not matching values in y, 
keeping just columns from x.

![](/srv/shiny-server/dplyr-part-2/images/draw_anti.png){width=90%}

```{r dplyr7, exercise = TRUE, exercise.eval = FALSE, exercise.cap = 'Anti Join'}

```

```{r dplyr7-solution}
anti_join(customer, order, by = "id")
```

## Full Join

<hr>

`full_join()` returns all rows and all columns from both x and y. Where there 
are not matching values, returns NA for the one missing.

![](/srv/shiny-server/dplyr-part-2/images/draw_full.png){width=90%}

```{r dplyr8, exercise = TRUE, exercise.eval = FALSE, exercise.cap = 'Full Join'}

```

```{r dplyr8-solution}
full_join(customer, order, by = "id")
```
