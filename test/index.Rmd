```{r setup, include=FALSE}
library(learnr)
library(readr)
library(dplyr)
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = FALSE)
ecom <- readr::read_csv('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rsquaredacademy/datasets/master/web.csv')
tutorial_options(exercise.completion = FALSE)
```

This code computes the answer to one plus one, change it so it computes two plus two:

```{r addition, exercise=TRUE}
1 + 1
```
