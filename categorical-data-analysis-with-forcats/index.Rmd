## Introduction

<hr>

In this module, we will learn to: 

- tabulate levels
- reorder levels
- reverse levels
- collapse levels
- recode levels
- recategorize levels
- shift levels

## Case Study

<hr>

We will use a case study to explore the various features of the forcats package. You can download the data for the case study from [here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rsquaredacademy/datasets/master/web.csv) or directly import the data using the readr package. In this case study, we will:

- compute the frequency of different referrers
- collapse referrers with low sample size into a single group
- club traffic from social media websites into a new category
- group referrers with traffic below a threshold into a single category

## Data

<hr>

The data set we will use has just one column `traffics` i.e. the source of 
traffic for a imaginary website.

```{r show, exercise = TRUE, exercise.eval = FALSE, exercise.cap = 'Data'}
traffic
```

## Data

<hr>

Let us extract the `traffics` column from the above data using and save it in a 
new variable `traffics`. Instead of using `traffic` which is a tibble, we will 
use `traffics` which is a vector. We do this to avoid extracting the `traffics` 
column from the main data repeatedly.

```{r import2a, exercise = TRUE, exercise.eval = FALSE, exercise.cap = 'Data'}
traffics
```
 
## Count 

<hr>

![](/srv/shiny-server/categorical-data-analysis-with-forcats/images/fct_count.png){width=90%}

## Count

<hr>

Let us compute the traffic driven by different referrers using `fct_count`.

```{r cat2, exercise = TRUE, exercise.eval = FALSE, exercise.cap = 'Tabulate Referrers'}

```

```{r cat2-solution}
fct_count(traffics)
```


## Levels

<hr>

Use `levels()` to display the categories/levels.

```{r cat2b, exercise = TRUE, exercise.eval = FALSE, exercise.cap = 'Levels'}

```

```{r cat2b-solution}
levels(traffics)
```


## Reorder 

<hr>

![](/srv/shiny-server/categorical-data-analysis-with-forcats/images/fct_infreq.png){width=90%}

## Reorder 

<hr>

The levels can be reordered based on their frequency using `fct_infreq()`.

```{r cat11, exercise = TRUE, exercise.eval = FALSE, exercise.cap = 'Reorder Referrers'}

```

```{r cat11-solution}
freq_traffic <- fct_infreq(traffics)
levels(freq_traffic)
```

## Reorder 

<hr>

![](/srv/shiny-server/categorical-data-analysis-with-forcats/images/fct_inorder.png){width=90%}

## Reorder

<hr>

The levels can be reordered based on the order of appearance using `fct_inorder()`.

```{r cat4, exercise = TRUE, exercise.eval = FALSE, exercise.cap = 'Reorder Referrers'}



```

```{r cat4-solution}
order_traffic <- fct_inorder(traffics)
levels(order_traffic)
```

## Reverse Levels

<hr>

![](/srv/shiny-server/categorical-data-analysis-with-forcats/images/fct_rev.png){width=90%}

## Reverse Levels

<hr>

The levels can be reversed using `fct_rev()`. 

```{r cat25, exercise = TRUE, exercise.eval = FALSE, exercise.cap = 'Data'}
reversed <- 


```

```{r cat25-solution}
reversed <- fct_rev(traffics)
levels(reversed)
```

## Collapse Categories

<hr>

![](/srv/shiny-server/categorical-data-analysis-with-forcats/images/fct_collapse.png){width=90%}

## Collapse Categories

<hr>

We want to group some of the referrers into 2 categories:

- social
- search

To group categories/levels, we will use `fct_collapse()`.

```{r cat7, exercise = TRUE, exercise.eval = FALSE, exercise.cap = 'Data'}



```

```{r cat7-solution}
traffics %>% 
  fct_collapse(
  social = c("facebook", "twitter", "instagram"),
  search = c("google", "bing", "yahoo")) %>% 
  fct_count() 
```

## Recode Levels

<hr>

![](/srv/shiny-server/categorical-data-analysis-with-forcats/images/fct_recode.png){width=90%}

## Recode Levels

<hr>

Categories/levels can be grouped using `fct_recode()` as well:

```{r recode, exercise = TRUE, exercise.eval = FALSE, exercise.cap = 'Data'}


```

```{r recode-solution}
fct_recode(traffics, search = "bing", search = "yahoo", search = "google",
  social = "facebook", social = "twitter", social = "instagram") %>%
  levels()
```


## Lump Categories

<hr>

![](/srv/shiny-server/categorical-data-analysis-with-forcats/images/fct_lump_1.png){width=90%}

## Lump Categories

<hr>

Let us group together referrer types that drive low traffic to the website. Use 
`fct_lump()` to lump together categories.

```{r cat8, echo=FALSE, eval=TRUE, collapse=FALSE}
fct_count(traffics)
```

```{r cat8b, exercise = TRUE, exercise.eval = FALSE, exercise.cap = 'Data'}



```

```{r cat8b-solution}
traffics %>% 
  fct_lump() %>% 
  table()
```

## Lump Categories

<hr>

We want to retain the top 3 referrers and combine the rest of them into a 
single category. Use `fct_lump()` and set the argument `n` to 3 indicating we 
want to retain top 3 categories and combine the rest.

```{r cat9, echo=FALSE, eval=TRUE, collapse=FALSE}
traffics %>% 
  fct_count() %>% 
  arrange(desc(n))
```

```{r cat17, exercise = TRUE, exercise.eval = FALSE, exercise.cap = 'Data'}



```

```{r cat17-solution}
traffics %>% 
  fct_lump(n = 3) %>% 
  table()
```

## Lump Categories

<hr>

![](/srv/shiny-server/categorical-data-analysis-with-forcats/images/fct_lump_2.png){width=90%}

## Lump Categories

<hr>

Let us combine referrers that drive less than 10% traffic to the website. Since 
we are looking at proportion of traffic driven to the website and not the 
actual numbers, we use the prop argument and set it to 0.1, indicating that we 
want to retain only those categories which have a proportion of more than 10% 
and combine the rest.

```{r cat13, echo=FALSE, eval=TRUE, collapse=FALSE}
traffics %>% 
  fct_count() %>%
  mutate(
    percent = round((n / sum(n)) * 100, 2)
  )
```

```{r cat18, exercise = TRUE, exercise.eval = FALSE, exercise.cap = 'Lump Categories'}



```

```{r cat18-solution}
traffics %>% 
  fct_lump(prop = 0.10) %>% 
  table()
```

## Lump Categories

<hr>

What if we want to retain 3 referrers which drive the lowest traffic to the 
website and combine the rest? We will still use the n argument but instead of 
specifying 3, we now specify -3.

```{r cat14, echo=FALSE, eval=TRUE, collapse=FALSE}
traffics %>% 
  fct_count() %>% 
  arrange(n)
```

```{r cat19, exercise = TRUE, exercise.eval = FALSE, exercise.cap = 'Lump Categories'}

```

```{r cat19-solution}
traffics %>% 
  fct_lump(n = -3) %>% 
  table()
```

## Lump Categories

<hr>

Let us see how to retain referrers that drive less than 10 % traffic to the 
website and combine the rest into a single group.

```{r cat15, echo=FALSE, eval=TRUE, collapse=FALSE}
traffics %>% 
  fct_count() %>%
  mutate(
    percent = round((n / sum(n)) * 100, 2)
  )
```

```{r cat20, exercise = TRUE, exercise.eval = FALSE, exercise.cap = 'Lump Categories'}


```

```{r cat20-solution}
traffics %>% 
  fct_lump(prop = -0.1) %>% 
  table()
```


## Replace Levels

<hr>

Let us assume we want to retain a couple of important categories and group the 
rest into a single category. In the below example, we retain google and yahoo 
while grouping the rest as others using `fct_other()`.

![](/srv/shiny-server/categorical-data-analysis-with-forcats/images/fct_others_1.png){width=90%}

## Replace Levels with Other

<hr>

```{r other_1, exercise = TRUE, exercise.eval = FALSE, exercise.cap = 'Data'}
keep_gy <- 


```

```{r other_1-solution}
keep_gy <- fct_other(traffics, keep = c("google", "yahoo"))
levels(keep_gy)
```


## Replace Levels

<hr>

What if you want to drop a couple of categories instead of grouping them? Use 
the `drop` argument in `fct_other()` and specify the categories to be dropped. 
In the below example, we drop the following referrer categories:

- instagram
- twitter

![](/srv/shiny-server/categorical-data-analysis-with-forcats/images/fct_others_2.png){width=90%}

## Replace Levels with Other

<hr>

```{r other_2, exercise = TRUE, exercise.eval = FALSE, exercise.cap = 'Data'}
drop_it <- 


```

```{r other_2-solution}
drop_it <- fct_other(traffics, drop = c("instagram", "twitter")) 
levels(drop_it)
```


## Reorder Levels

<hr>

The categories can be reordered using `fct_relevel()`. In the below example, 
we reorder the categories to ensure google appears first. 

![](/srv/shiny-server/categorical-data-analysis-with-forcats/images/fct_relevel_1.png){width=90%}

## Reorder Levels

<hr>

Similarly, in the below example, we reorder the levels to ensure twitter 
appears first irrespective of its frequency or order of appearance in the data.


```{r relevel_1, exercise = TRUE, exercise.eval = FALSE, exercise.cap = 'Reorder Levels'}
move_twitter <- 


```

```{r relevel_1-solution}
move_twitter <- fct_relevel(traffics, "twitter") 
levels(move_twitter)
```

## Reorder Levels

<hr>

If the category needs to appear at a particular position, use the `after` 
argument and specify the position after which it should appear. For example, 
if google should be the third category, we would specify `after = 2` i.e. 
google should come after the 2nd position (i.e. third position).

![](/srv/shiny-server/categorical-data-analysis-with-forcats/images/fct_relevel_2.png){width=90%}

## Reorder Levels

<hr>

```{r relevel_2, exercise = TRUE, exercise.eval = FALSE, exercise.cap = 'Reorder Levels'}
appear_2 <- 


```

```{r relevel_2-solution}
appear_2 <- fct_relevel(traffics, "google", after = 2)
levels(appear_2)
```

## Reorder Levels

<hr>

If the category should appear last, supply the value `Inf` (infinity) to the 
`after` argument as shown below.

![](/srv/shiny-server/categorical-data-analysis-with-forcats/images/fct_relevel_3.png){width=90%}

## Reorder Levels

<hr>

```{r relevel_3, exercise = TRUE, exercise.eval = FALSE, exercise.cap = 'Reorder Levels'}
appear_last <- 


```

```{r relevel_3-solution}
appear_last <- fct_relevel(traffics, "facebook", after = Inf) 
levels(appear_last)
```


## Case Study 3

<hr>

In this case study, we deal with categorical data which is ordered and 
cyclical. It contains response to an imaginary survey.

### Data

<hr>

```{r import2b, exercise = TRUE, exercise.eval = FALSE, exercise.cap = 'Import Data'}
```

```{r import2b-solution}
responses
```

## Shift Levels

<hr>

![](/srv/shiny-server/categorical-data-analysis-with-forcats/images/fct_shift_1.png){width=90%}

## Shift Levels

<hr>

To shift the levels, we use `fct_shift()`. Use the `n` argument to indicate the 
direction of the shift. If `n` is positive, the levels are shifted to the left 
else to the right. In the below example, we shift the levels to the left by 2 positions.

```{r shift_1, exercise = TRUE, exercise.eval = FALSE, exercise.cap = 'Shift Levels'}
shift_left <- 

```

```{r shift_1-solution}
shift_left <- fct_shift(responses, 2) 
levels(shift_left)
```

## Shift Levels

<hr>

![](/srv/shiny-server/categorical-data-analysis-with-forcats/images/fct_shift_2.png){width=90%}

## Shift Levels

<hr>

To shift the levels to the right, supply a negative value to the `n` argument 
in `fct_shift()`. In the below example, we shift the levels to the right by 2 
positions.

```{r shift_2, exercise = TRUE, exercise.eval = FALSE, exercise.cap = 'Shift Levels'}
shift_right <- 
```

```{r shift_2-solution}
shift_right <- fct_shift(responses, -2) 
levels(shift_right)
```
