course_interval <- interval(course_start, course_end)
```

## Introduction

<hr>

 In this module, we will learn to work with date/time data in R using [lubridate]( https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=lubridate), an R package that makes it easy to work with dates and time. Let us begin by installing and loading the lubridate pacakge.

## Origin

<hr>

Let us look at the origin for the numbering system used for date and time calculations in R.

```{r origin, exercise = TRUE, exercise.eval = FALSE, exercise.cap = 'Origin'}



```

```{r origin-solution}
lubridate::origin
```

## Current Date/Time

<hr>

Next, let us check out the current date, time and whether it occurs in the am or 
pm. `now()` returns the date, time as well as the time zone whereas `today()` 
will return only the current date. `am()` and `pm()` return TRUE or FALSE.

```{r today, exercise = TRUE, exercise.eval = FALSE, exercise.cap = 'Current Date and Time'}



```

```{r today-solution}
now()
today()
am(now())
pm(now())
```

## Data

<hr>

```{r show, exercise = TRUE, exercise.eval = FALSE, exercise.cap = 'Data'}
transact
```

## Data Dictionary

<hr>

The data set has 3 columns. All the dates are in the format (yyyy-mm-dd).

- Invoice: invoice date 
- Due: due date
- Payment: payment date

## Case Study

<hr>

We will use the functions in the lubridate package to answer a few 
questions we have about the transact data.

- extract date, month and year from Due
- compute the number of days to settle invoice
- compute days over due
- check if due year is a leap year
- check when due day in february is 29, whether it is a leap year
- how many invoices were settled within due date
- how many invoices are due in each quarter
- what is the average duration between invoice date and payment date

## Extract Date, Month & Year 

<hr>

![](/srv/shiny-server/manipulate-date-time-with-lubridate/images/day_week_month.png){width=90%}

## Extract Date, Month & Year 

<hr>

The first thing we will learn is to extract the date, month and year.

```{r lub18, exercise = TRUE, exercise.eval = FALSE, exercise.cap = 'Date, Month & YEar'}
this_day <- as_date('2017-03-23')




```

```{r lub18-solution}
this_day <- as_date('2017-03-23')
day(this_day)
month(this_day)
year(this_day)
```

## Case Study

<hr>

Let us now extract the date, month and year from the `Due` column.

```{r lub2, exercise = TRUE, exercise.eval = FALSE, exercise.cap = 'Case Study'}
mutate(transact, 
  due_day   = ,
  due_month = ,
  due_year  = 
)
```

```{r lub2-solution}
mutate(transact,
  due_day   = day(Due),
  due_month = month(Due),
  due_year  = year(Due)
)
```

## Course Duration

<hr>

![](/srv/shiny-server/manipulate-date-time-with-lubridate/images/course_duration.png){width=90%}

## Course Duration

<hr>

Time to do some arithmetic with the dates. Let us calculate the duration of a course by subtracting the course start date from the course end date.

```{r lub19, exercise = TRUE, exercise.eval = FALSE, exercise.cap = 'Course Duration'}
course_start    <- as_date('2017-04-12')
course_end      <- as_date('2017-04-21')
course_duration <- 
course_duration
```

```{r lub19-solution}
course_start    <- as_date('2017-04-12')
course_end      <- as_date('2017-04-21')
course_duration <- course_end - course_start
course_duration
```

## Case Study

<hr>

Let us estimate the number of days to settle the invoice by subtracting the 
date of invoice from the date of payment.

```{r lub3, exercise = TRUE, exercise.eval = FALSE, exercise.cap = 'Case Study'}
mutate(transact,
  days_to_pay = 
)
```

```{r lub3-solution}
mutate(transact,
  days_to_pay = Payment - Invoice
)
```

## Case Study

<hr>

How many of the invoices were settled post the due date? We can find this by:

- subtracting the due date from the payment date
- counting the number of rows where delay < 0


```{r lub4, exercise = TRUE, exercise.eval = FALSE, exercise.cap = 'Case Study'}
transact %>%
  mutate(
    delay = 
  ) %>%
  filter() %>%
  tally()
```

```{r lub4-solution}
transact %>%
  mutate(
    delay = Due - Payment
  ) %>%
  filter(delay < 0) %>%
  tally()
```

## Case Study

Just for fun, let us check if the due year happens to be a leap year.

<hr>

```{r lub5, exercise = TRUE, exercise.eval = FALSE, exercise.cap = 'Case Study'}
mutate(transact
  is_leap  = 
)
```

```{r lub5-solution}
mutate(transact
  is_leap  = leap_year(Due)
)
```

## Case Study

Let us do some data sanitization. If the due day happens to be February 29, let 
us ensure that the due year is a leap year. Below are the steps to check if the 
due year is a leap year:

- we will extract the following from the due date:
  - day
  - month
  - year
- we will then create a new column is_leap which will have be set to TRUE if 
the year is a leap year else it will be set to FALSE
- filter all the payments due on 29th Feb
- select the following columns:
  - Due
  - is_leap

<hr>

```{r lub6, exercise = TRUE, exercise.eval = FALSE, exercise.cap = 'Case Study'}
transact %>%
  mutate(
    due_day   = ,
    due_month = ,
    due_year  = ,
    is_leap   = 
  ) %>%
  select() %>%
  filter()
```

```{r lub6-solution}
transact %>%
  mutate(
    due_day   = day(Due),
    due_month = month(Due),
    due_year  = year(Due),
    is_leap   = leap_year(due_year)
  ) %>%
  select(-(Invoice), -(Payment)) %>%
  filter(due_month == 2 & due_day == 29)
```

## Shift Date

<hr>

![](/srv/shiny-server/manipulate-date-time-with-lubridate/images/shift_dates.png){width=90%}

## Shift Date

<hr>

Time to shift some dates. We can shift a date by days, weeks or months. Let us 
shift the course start date by:

- 2 days
- 3 weeks
- 1 year


```{r lab40, exercise = TRUE, exercise.eval = FALSE, exercise.cap = 'Shifting Dates'}
course_start + 
course_start + 
course_start + 
```

```{r lab40-solution}
course_start + days(2)
course_start + weeks(1)
course_start + years(1)
```

## Interval

<hr>

![](/srv/shiny-server/manipulate-date-time-with-lubridate/images/course_interval.png){width=90%}

## Interval

<hr>

Let us calculate the duration of the course using `interval`. If you observe 
carefully, the result is not the duration in days but an object of class 
`interval`. Now let us learn how we can use intervals.

```{r lub10, exercise = TRUE, exercise.eval = FALSE, exercise.cap = 'Interval'}



```

```{r lub10-solution}
interval(course_start, course_end)
```

## Shift Interval

<hr>

![](/srv/shiny-server/manipulate-date-time-with-lubridate/images/shift_interval.png){width=90%}

## Shift Interval

<hr>

Intervals can be shifted too. In the below example, we shift the course interval by:

- 1 day
- 3 weeks
- 1 year


```{r lab50, exercise = TRUE, exercise.eval = FALSE, exercise.cap = 'Shifting Intervals'}
course_interval <- interval(course_start, course_end)
int_shift(course_interval, by = )
int_shift(course_interval, by = )
int_shift(course_interval, by = )
```

```{r lab50-solution}
course_interval <- interval(course_start, course_end)
int_shift(course_interval, by = days(1))
int_shift(course_interval, by = weeks(3))
int_shift(course_interval, by = years(1))
```

## Intervals Overlap

<hr>

![](/srv/shiny-server/manipulate-date-time-with-lubridate/images/interval_overlap.png){width=90%}

## Intervals Overlap

<hr>

Let us say you are planning a vacation and want to check if the vacation dates 
overlap with the course dates. You can do this by:

- creating vacation and course intervals
- use `int_overlaps()` to check if two intervals overlap. It returns `TRUE` if 
the intervals overlap else `FALSE`.

Let us use the vacation start and end dates to create `vacation_interval` and 
then check if it overlaps with `course_interval`.

```{r lub60, exercise = TRUE, exercise.eval = FALSE, exercise.cap = 'Overlapping Intervals'}
vacation_start    <- as_date('2017-04-19')
vacation_end      <- as_date('2017-04-25')
vacation_interval <- 

```

```{r lub60-solution}
vacation_start    <- as_date('2017-04-19')
vacation_end      <- as_date('2017-04-25')
vacation_interval <- interval(vacation_start, vacation_end)
int_overlaps(course_interval, vacation_interval)
```

## Case Study

<hr>

Let us use intervals to count the number of invoices that were settled within 
the due date. To do this, we will:

- create an interval for the invoice and due date
- create a new column due_next by incrementing the due date by 1 day
- another interval for due_next and the payment date
- if the intervals overlap, the payment was made within the due date


```{r lub7, exercise = TRUE, exercise.eval = FALSE, exercise.cap = 'Case Study'}
transact %>%
  mutate(
    inv_due_interval = ,
    due_next         = ,
    due_pay_interval = ,
    overlaps         = 
  ) %>%
  select()
```

```{r lub7-solution}
transact %>%
  mutate(
    inv_due_interval = interval(Invoice, Due),
    due_next         = Due + days(1),
    due_pay_interval = interval(due_next, Payment),
    overlaps         = int_overlaps(inv_due_interval, due_pay_interval)
  ) %>%
  select(Invoice, Due, Payment, overlaps)
```

## Case Study

<hr>

Below we show another method to count the number of invoices paid within the 
due date. Instead of using days to change the due date, we use `int_shift` to 
shift it by 1 day.

```{r lub12, exercise = TRUE, exercise.eval = FALSE, exercise.cap = 'Case Study'}
# using int_shift
transact %>%
  mutate(
    inv_due_interval = interval(Invoice, Due),
    due_pay_interval = interval(Due, Payment),  
    due_pay_next     = int_shift(due_pay_interval, by = days(1)),
    overlaps         = int_overlaps(inv_due_interval, due_pay_next)
  ) %>%
  select(Invoice, Due, Payment, overlaps)
```

## Within

<hr>

![](/srv/shiny-server/manipulate-date-time-with-lubridate/images/within.png){width=90%}

## Within

<hr>

Let us assume that we have to attend a conference in April 2017. Does it occur 
during the course duration? We can answer this using `%within%` which will 
return `TRUE` if a date falls within an interval.

```{r lub30, exercise = TRUE, exercise.eval = FALSE, exercise.cap = 'Within'}
conference <- as_date('2017-04-15')

```

```{r lub30-solution}
conference <- as_date('2017-04-15')
conference %within% interval(course_start, course_end)
```

## Case Study

<hr>

Let us use `%within%` to count the number of invoices that were settled within 
the due date. We will do this by:

- creating an interval for the invoice and due date
- check if the payment date falls within the above interval

```{r lub13, exercise = TRUE, exercise.eval = FALSE, exercise.cap = 'Case Study'}
transact %>%
  mutate(
    inv_due_interval = ,
    overlaps = 
  ) %>%
  select()
```

```{r lub13-solution}
transact %>%
  mutate(
    inv_due_interval = interval(Invoice, Due),
    overlaps = Payment %within% inv_due_interval
  ) %>%
  select(Due, Payment, overlaps)
```

## Quarter

<hr>

![](/srv/shiny-server/manipulate-date-time-with-lubridate/images/quarter_semester.png){width=90%}

## Quarter

<hr>

Let us check the quarter and the semester in which the course starts.

```{r lub20, exercise = TRUE, exercise.eval = FALSE, exercise.cap = 'Quarter & Semester'}
course_start




```

```{r lub20-solution}
course_start
quarter(course_start)
quarter(course_start, with_year = TRUE)
semester(course_start)  
```

## Case Study

<hr>

Let us count the invoices due for each quarter.

```{r lub8, exercise = TRUE, exercise.eval = FALSE, exercise.cap = 'Case Study'}
transact %>%
  mutate(
    quarter_due = 
  ) %>%
  count()
```

```{r lub8-solution}
transact %>%
  mutate(
    quarter_due = quarter(Due)
  ) %>%
  count(quarter_due)
```

## Convert

<hr>

![](/srv/shiny-server/manipulate-date-time-with-lubridate/images/convert.png){width=90%}

## Case Study

<hr>

Let us also get the course interval in different units.

```{r lub11, exercise = TRUE, exercise.eval = FALSE, exercise.cap = 'Convert Units'}
course_interval / 
course_interval / 
course_interval / 
course_interval / 
course_interval / 
```

```{r lub11-solution}
course_interval / dseconds()
course_interval / dminutes()
course_interval / dhours()
course_interval / dweeks()
course_interval / dyears()
```

## Convert

<hr>

![](/srv/shiny-server/manipulate-date-time-with-lubridate/images/time_length.png){width=90%}

## Case Study

<hr>

We can use `time_length()` to get the course interval in different units.

```{r lub16, exercise = TRUE, exercise.eval = FALSE, exercise.cap = 'Convert Units'}
time_length(course_interval, )
time_length(course_interval, )
time_length(course_interval, )
```

```{r lub16-solution}
time_length(course_interval, unit = "seconds")
time_length(course_interval, unit = "minutes")
time_length(course_interval, unit = "hours")
```

## Convert

<hr>

![](/srv/shiny-server/manipulate-date-time-with-lubridate/images/as_period.png){width=90%}

## Case Study

<hr>

`as.period()` is yet another way to get the course interval in different units.

```{r lub17, exercise = TRUE, exercise.eval = FALSE, exercise.cap = 'Convert Units'}
as.period(course_interval, )
as.period(course_interval, )
as.period(course_interval, )
```

```{r lub17-solution}
as.period(course_interval, unit = "seconds")
as.period(course_interval, unit = "minutes")
as.period(course_interval, unit = "hours")
```
