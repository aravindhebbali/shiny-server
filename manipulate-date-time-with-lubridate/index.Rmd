library(learnr)
library(lubridate)
library(dplyr)

transact <- read_csv('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rsquaredacademy/datasets/master/transact.csv')
```

## Introduction

<hr>

 In this module, we will learn to work with date/time data in R using [lubridate]( https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=lubridate), an R package that makes it easy to work with dates and time. Let us begin by installing and loading the lubridate pacakge.

## Origin

<hr>

```{r origin, exercise = TRUE, exercise.eval = FALSE, exercise.cap = 'Data'}
lubridate::origin()
```

## Current Date/Time

<hr>

```{r today, exercise = TRUE, exercise.eval = FALSE, exercise.cap = 'Data'}
now()
today()
am(now())  
pm(now())
```

## Data

<hr>

```{r show, exercise = TRUE, exercise.eval = FALSE, exercise.cap = 'Data'}
transact <- read_csv('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rsquaredacademy/datasets/master/transact.csv')
transact
```

## Data Dictionary

<hr>

The data set has 3 columns. All the dates are in the format (yyyy-mm-dd).

- Invoice: invoice date 
- Due: due date
- Payment: payment date

## Case Study

<hr>

We will use the functions in the lubridate package to answer a few 
questions we have about the transact data.

- extract date, month and year from Due
- compute the number of days to settle invoice
- compute days over due
- check if due year is a leap year
- check when due day in february is 29, whether it is a leap year
- how many invoices were settled within due date
- how many invoices are due in each quarter
- what is the average duration between invoice date and payment date

## Extract Date, Month & Year 

<hr>

## Extract Date, Month & Year 

<hr>

```{r lub18, exercise = TRUE, exercise.eval = FALSE, exercise.cap = 'Data'}
this_day <- as_date('2017-03-23')
day(this_day)
month(this_day)
year(this_day)
```

## Extract Date, Month & Year

<hr>

```{r lub2, exercise = TRUE, exercise.eval = FALSE, exercise.cap = 'Data'}
transact %>%
  mutate(
    due_day   = day(Due),
    due_month = month(Due),
    due_year  = year(Due)
  )
```

## Course Duration

<hr>

## Course Duration

<hr>


```{r lub19, exercise = TRUE, exercise.eval = FALSE, exercise.cap = 'Data'}
course_start    <- as_date('2017-04-12')
course_end      <- as_date('2017-04-21')
course_duration <- course_end - course_start
course_duration
```

## Date Arithmetic

<hr>

Compute days to settle invoice

```{r lub3, exercise = TRUE, exercise.eval = FALSE, exercise.cap = 'Data'}
transact %>%
  mutate(
    days_to_pay = Payment - Invoice
  )
```

## Date Arithmetic

<hr>

Compute days over due

```{r lub4, exercise = TRUE, exercise.eval = FALSE, exercise.cap = 'Data'}
transact %>%
  mutate(
    delay = Payment - Due
  )
```

## Leap Year

Is due year a leap year?

<hr>

```{r lub5, exercise = TRUE, exercise.eval = FALSE, exercise.cap = 'Data'}
transact %>%
  mutate(
    due_year = year(Due),
    is_leap  = leap_year(due_year)
  )
```

## Leap Year

If due day is February 29, is it a leap year?

<hr>

```{r lub6, exercise = TRUE, exercise.eval = FALSE, exercise.cap = 'Data'}
transact %>%
  mutate(
    due_day   = day(Due),
    due_month = month(Due),
    due_year  = year(Due),
    is_leap   = leap_year(due_year)
  ) %>%
  select(-(Invoice), -(Payment)) %>%
  filter(due_month == 2 & due_day == 29)
```

## Shift Date
